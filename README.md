## Usage:-

- Clone my repository.
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `Window+Android_GUI.py`. You can see it is GUI developed using KivyMD, which is running on windows. 
- Now we have to convert that GUI(.py) code to APK.
- For converting python code to APK we need to have linux or mac OS, but dont't worry we have google colab.
- I have given `android_app.ipynb`, I already given all the instructions of converting code to APK in that `.ipynb` file. Run that in google colab.
